# Project 59: Shape Classification

## Authors: Julen Etxaniz and Ibon Urbina

## Subject: Machine Learning and Neural Networks

## Date: 25/10/2020

## Objective: The goal of the project is to compare different classification algorithms on the solution of plane and car shape datasets.

## Description: This repository contains a project description, a written report describing the solution, a Jupyter Notebook with the implementation and the shape datasets.

## Contents of the Notebook:

### 1.Importing the libraries

### 2.Reading the datasets

### 3.Preprocessing the datasets

### 4.Scaling the data

### 5.Dividing train and test data

### 6.Classification

### 7.Validation

### 8.Feature Selection

### 9.Feature Engineering

### 10.Pipeline Optimization
